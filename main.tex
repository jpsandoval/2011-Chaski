\section{}

The main difficulty of making a dynamic analysis is the large amount of data collected from the execution of code, so as performance and scalability problems.

One of the biggest problems in software maintenance is to understand the behavior of the software, dynamic analysis is necessary to perform this task.

It is difficult to navigate the vast(large) amount of information obtained from the code execution, always trying not to get lost in the visualization. (Browser)


Layout Chaski

The essence of chaski are the messages and the chronological order in which these (messages) occur.

The large-scale sequence of messages makes the screen resolution not enough to show a lot of information,causing the emergence of scrolls that make the graphics difficult to understand.

The layout of chaski allows the user to group the messages by different criteria, such as per package, class, object, method with blue, red, yellow and green colors, respectively, or a combination of these but respecting the hierarchy.

Detecting important messages.

To help mark or highlight the messages you want to analyze, chaski provides a simple mechanism of colored rules of messages, it allows to color a message given a particular criterion. If you have multiple criteria and, in the case that one or more messages meet more than one criterion, these will take the color of the last criterion.

Important message filtering.

So like a lot of objects are created when executing an object-oriented program,  so much larger the number of messages that are sent between objects, making the visualization extremely large. The filters in chaski try to display messages that meet a certain condition allowing a smaller view and most importantly, making  possible to analyze only the messages that interest us.
